The LC-3b was orignally created by Dr. Yale Patt. In lab 1, we have created an assembler that converts assembly code into machinecode. In lab 2, we have created a simulator that sequentially performs the operations of 
each of the assembly instructions defined by the LC-3b ISA. The output of the operations is printed to the console. These two labs were done in collaboration with my lab partner Aniketh Devarasetty. 

Starter code that was not of our own work is marked with a disclaimer comment.
