# ComputerArchitecture
The LC-3b was orignally created by Dr. Yale Patt. In lab 1, we have created an assembler that converts assembly code into machinecode. In lab 2, we have created a simulator that sequentially performs the operations of each of the assembly instructions defined by the LC-3b ISA. The output of the operations is printed to the console. These labs 1 and 2 were done in collaboration with my lab partner Aniketh Devarasetty. In lab3, I programmed a cyclical implementation of the LC-3b ISA based on the MicroArchitecture created by Dr. Yale Patt. 

Starter code that was not of our own work is marked with a disclaimer comment.
