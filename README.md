# ComputerArchitecture
The LC-3b was orignally created by Dr. Yale Patt. In lab 1, we have created an assembler that converts assembly code into machinecode. In lab 2, we have created a simulator that sequentially performs the operations of each of the assembly instructions defined by the LC-3b ISA. The output of the operations is printed to the console. Labs 1 and 2 were done in collaboration with my lab partner Aniketh Devarasetty. 
Lab 3 implements a cyclical version of the LC-3b ISA. 
Lab 4 extends lab 3 by adding the extra functionality of exceptions and interrupts. 
Lab 5 further extends labs 3 and 4 by implementing virtual memory. 
Lab 6 implements a pipelined version of the LC-3b. 

Starter code that was not of our own work is marked with a disclaimer comment.
